Consider the circuit shown in the figure a condenser C, resistance R, Ballastic Galvanomenter B.G. and cell of emf E is connected in as shown in the circuit. Keeping K<sub>2</sub> and K<sub>3</sub> open, the capacitor is charged by depressing the key K<sub>1</sub>. K<sub>1</sub> is then opened and at once K<sub>3</sub> is closed. The capacitor discharges through the galvanometer, &theta;<sub>0</sub> is proportional to Q<sub>0</sub>. The capacitor is again charged, the throw  which records a throw to the maximum value keeping K<sub>2</sub> and K<sub>3</sub> open and K<sub>1</sub> closed. K<sub>1</sub> is then opened and K<sub>2</sub> is closed for a known time t. Some of the charge leaks through R. K<sub>2</sub> is opened and at once K<sub>3</sub> is closed. The charge Q remaining on the capacitor is noted by noting the value of &theta; (deflection produced in the Ballastic Galvanometer). <br>

If a charged condenser of capacity C (having self leakage resistance ‘r’) is discharged through any high resistance R in time‘t’ then<br>
<img src="images/fig2.PNG"><br>
the graph between <img src="images/fig3_formula.PNG"> and t will be straight line.<br><br>
where &theta;<sub>0</sub> = the deflection corresponding to the first throw of the galvanometer
          &theta; = the deflection of the galvanometer when the capacitor is discharged through resistor R.
The relation (1) can also be written as <br>

Where &alpha; = the deflection of the galvanometer when the capacitor is discharged through resistor R'<br>
and R՛ is the resistance of the equivalent parallel resistance of the galvanometer and self leakage resistance r of the condenser.<br>
