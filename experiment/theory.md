If a charged condenser of capacity C (having self leakage resistance ‘r’) is discharged through any high resistance R then

the graph between log<sub>10</sub>⁡〖θ<sub>0</sub>/θ〗  and t will be straight line.<br><br>

where θ<sub>0</sub> = the deflection corresponding to the first throw of the galvanometer<br>
          θ = the deflection of the galvanometer when the capacitor is discharged through resistor R.<br>
The relation (1) can also be written as <br>

Where α = the deflection of the galvanometer when the capacitor is discharged through resistor R՛
and R՛ is the resistance of the equivalent parallel resistance of the galvanometer and self leakage resistance r of the condenser.<br>
