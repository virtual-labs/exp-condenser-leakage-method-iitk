If a charged condenser of capacity C (having self leakage resistance ‘r’) is discharged through any high resistance R then
log<sub>10</sub>⁡(θ<sub>0</sub>/θ= t/2.303RC〗	-------- (1)

the graph between log<sub>10</sub>⁡〖θ<sub>0</sub>/θ〗  and t will be straight line.

where θ<sub>0</sub> = the deflection corresponding to the first throw of the galvanometer
          θ = the deflection of the galvanometer when the capacitor is discharged through resistor R.
The relation (1) can also be written as 
log<sub>10</sub>⁡〖θ<sub>0</sub>/α= t/(2.303R՛C)〗	-------- (2)
Where α = the deflection of the galvanometer when the capacitor is discharged through resistor R՛
and R՛ is the resistance of the equivalent parallel resistance of the galvanometer and self leakage resistance r of the condenser.
1/(R՛)=1/r+1/R                       ---------- (3)
